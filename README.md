   $ZOO
   
   #LIQ+#RFI+#SHIB+#DOGE => #PIG 
   #PIG =solidity:= 0.8; Liquidity:=10; tax:=20=> #ZOO
   Make $ZOO a Welfare Society!

   Great features:
   10% fee auto add to the liquidity pool to locked forever when selling
   20% fee auto distribute to all holders
   50% burn to the black hole, with such big black hole and 10% fee, the strong holder will get a valuable reward

   I will burn liquidity LPs to burn addresses to lock the pool forever.
   I will renounce the ownership to burn addresses to transfer #ZOO to the community, make sure it's 100% safe.

   I will add 0.999 BNB and all the left 49.5% total supply to the pool
   Can you make #ZOO 10000000X? 

   1,000,000,000,000,000 total supply
   5,000,000,000,000 tokens limitation for trade
   0% tokens for dev

   10% fee for liquidity will go to an address that the contract creates, 
   and the contract will sell it and add to liquidity automatically, 
   it's the best part of the #ZOO idea, increasing the liquidity pool automatically, 
   help the pool grow from the small init pool.
